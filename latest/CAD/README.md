## Board design files

This directory contains Eagle CAD files as well as schematic PDFs and Gerber exports for board fabrication.

The board stackup is good enough for either OSH Park 4-layer, or JLCPCB 4-layer with controlled impedance (JLC2313). 

### Latest Board

Revision 6.1.0 is latest. I built it at JLCPCB with the exact gerber files I posted here. It is fully functional and performed as expected.

The 6.1 directory also contains a reference design for a breakout to help with development and debugging. The breakout
features a CH330N USB-to-UART adapter IC as well as a TX "on/off" switch so you can get some ideas about how to interface to the
unit from your own system. You can build this breakout by ordering this OSHPARK board: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/uhYKW499
